OVERVIEW:
---------

These files are modified to conform to the USPTO's utility patent
specification, drawings, and claims guidelines. They are simple modifications
to the article class. Instead of a complicated multi- file project this task
is achieved as simple example consisting of the patent.tex and drawing-1.svg
One can generate patent.pdf with:
 make patent.pdf

The other target (drawings.pdf) can be achieved by converting the drawing-1.svg to pdf

FILES:
------

config/commands.def	Applicable environment/commands (do not modify)
config/config.tex	Document package configuration (do not modify)

Makefile		GNU make compatible makefile
README			This file
patent.tex		Full text of the example patent including specification, abstract and claims
drawing-1.svg		Example drawing confogming to the USPTO format requirements


WRITING YOUR PATENT SPEC:
-------------------------

The only file to edit is the patent.tex to generate your patent.pdf. 

DRAWINGS:
---------
Replace the drawings in drawing-1.svg and generate your own drawings.pdf
Drawings are quite easy to do, just follow the basic guidelines in the
USPTO's `Guide to Filing A Non-Provisional (Utility) Patent Application'. 
Basically, drawing with black ink or computer, use only that ink for all
shading (no grey, use dots or lines for shading), use zebra stripes for
cross sections, make all numbers and letters legibly large, and make the
line going from each number or letter to the feature clear and unambiguous.


SUPPORT/WARRANTY:
-----------------

There is no support or warranty provided for the use of this template. 
The authors wrote it because using LaTeX for filing patent applications is a
natural fit - and providing it to the public is a nice thing to do.
